A Novel Threshold-Free Network-Based Statistics Method: Demonstration using Simulated Pathology. OHBM, 2015, 4144; \nand: \nVinokur, L.; Zalesky, A.; Raffelt, D.; Smith, R.E. & Connelly, A. A novel threshold-free network-based statistical method: Demonstration and parameter optimisation using in vivo simulated pathology. In Proc ISMRM, 2015, 2846. \nNote however that not only was the optimisation of these parameters not very precise, but the outcomes of statistical inference (for both this algorithm and the NBS method) can vary markedly for even small changes to enhancement parameters. Therefore the specificity of results obtained using either of these methods should be interpreted with caution.\n\nIn some software packages, a column of ones is automatically added to the GLM design matrix; the purpose of this column is to estimate the \"global intercept\", which is the predicted value of the observed variable if all explanatory variables were to be zero. However there are rare situations where including such a column would not be appropriate for a particular experimental design. Hence, in MRtrix3 statistical inference commands, it is up to the user to determine whether or not this column of ones should be included in their design matrix, and add it explicitly if necessary. The contrast matrix must also reflect the presence of this additional column.\n\nReferences:\n\n* If using the NBS algorithm: \nZalesky, A.; Fornito, A. & Bullmore, E. T.
