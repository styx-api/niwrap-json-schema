  "description": "Obtain an estimate of fibre connectivity between two regions using AFD and streamlines tractography.\n\nThis estimate is obtained by determining a fibre volume (AFD) occupied by the pathway of interest, and dividing by the streamline length.\n\nIf only the streamlines belonging to the pathway of interest are provided, then ALL of the fibre volume within each fixel selected will contribute to the result. If the -wbft option is used to provide whole-brain fibre-tracking (of which the pathway of interest should contain a subset), only the fraction of the fibre volume in each fixel estimated to belong to the pathway of interest will contribute to the result.\n\nUse -quiet to suppress progress messages and output fibre connectivity value only.\n\nFor valid comparisons of AFD connectivity across scans, images MUST be intensity normalised and bias field corrected, and a common response function for all subjects must be used.\n\nNote that the sum of the AFD is normalised by streamline length to account for subject differences in fibre bundle length. This normalisation results in a measure that is more related to the cross-sectional volume of the tract (and therefore 'connectivity'). Note that SIFT-ed tract count is a superior measure because it is unaffected by tangential yet unrelated fibres. However, AFD connectivity may be used as a substitute when Anatomically Constrained Tractography is not possible due to uncorrectable EPI distortions, and SIFT may therefore not be as effective.\n\nLonger discussion regarding this command can additionally be found at: https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.4/concepts/afd_connectivity.html (as well as in the relevant reference).\n\nReferences:\n\nSmith, R.
