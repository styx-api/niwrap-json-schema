  "description": "Diffusion (kurtosis) tensor estimation.\n\nBy default, the diffusion tensor (and optionally its kurtosis) is fitted to the log-signal in two steps: firstly, using weighted least-squares (WLS) with weights based on the empirical signal intensities; secondly, by further iterated weighted least-squares (IWLS) with weights determined by the signal predictions from the previous iteration (by default, 2 iterations will be performed). This behaviour can be altered in two ways:\n\n* The -ols option will cause the first fitting step to be performed using ordinary least-squares (OLS); that is, all measurements contribute equally to the fit, instead of the default behaviour of weighting based on the empirical signal intensities.\n\n* The -iter option controls the number of iterations of the IWLS prodedure. If this is set to zero, then the output model parameters will be those resulting from the first fitting step only: either WLS by default, or OLS if the -ols option is used in conjunction with -iter 0.\n\nThe tensor coefficients are stored in the output image as follows:\nvolumes 0-5: D11, D22, D33, D12, D13, D23\n\nIf diffusion kurtosis is estimated using the -dkt option, these are stored as follows:\nvolumes 0-2: W1111, W2222, W3333\nvolumes 3-8: W1112, W1113, W1222, W1333, W2223, W2333\nvolumes 9-11: W1122, W1133, W2233\nvolumes 12-14: W1123, W1223, W1233\n\nReferences:\n\nReferences based on fitting algorithm used:\n\n* OLS, WLS:\nBasser, P.J.; Mattiello, J.; LeBihan, D.
