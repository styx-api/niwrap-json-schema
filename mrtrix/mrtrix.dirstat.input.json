  "description": "Report statistics on a direction set.\n\nThis command will accept as inputs:\n\n- directions file in spherical coordinates (ASCII text, [ az el ] space-separated values, one per line);\n\n- directions file in Cartesian coordinates (ASCII text, [ x y z ] space-separated values, one per line);\n\n- DW gradient files (MRtrix format: ASCII text, [ x y z b ] space-separated values, one per line);\n\n- image files, using the DW gradient scheme found in the header (or provided using the appropriate command line options below).\n\nBy default, this produces all relevant metrics for the direction set provided. If the direction set contains multiple shells, metrics are provided for each shell separately.\n\nMetrics are produced assuming a unipolar or bipolar electrostatic repulsion model, producing the potential energy (total, mean, min & max), and the nearest-neighbour angles (mean, min & max). The condition number is also produced for the spherical harmonic fits up to the highest harmonic order supported by the number of volumes. Finally, the norm of the mean direction vector is provided as a measure of the overall symmetry of the direction set (important with respect to eddy-current resilience).\n\nSpecific metrics can also be queried independently via the \"-output\" option, using these shorthands: \nU/B for unipolar/bipolar model, \nE/N for energy and nearest-neighbour respectively, \nt/-/+ for total/min/max respectively (mean implied otherwise); \nSHn for condition number of SH fit at order n (with n an even integer); \nASYM for asymmetry index (norm of mean direction vector); \nN for the number of directions.\n\nReferences:\n\n",
