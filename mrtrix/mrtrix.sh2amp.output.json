  "description": "Evaluate the amplitude of an image of spherical harmonic functions along specified directions.\n\nThe input image should consist of a 4D or 5D image, with SH coefficients along the 4th dimension according to the convention below. If 4D (or size 1 along the 5th dimension), the program expects to be provided with a single shell of directions. If 5D, each set of coefficients along the 5th dimension is understood to correspond to a different shell.\n\nThe directions can be provided as:\n- a 2-column ASCII text file contained azimuth / elevation pairs (as produced by dirgen)\n- a 3-column ASCII text file containing x, y, z Cartesian direction vectors (as produced by dirgen -cart)\n- a 4-column ASCII text file containing the x, y, z, b components of a full DW encoding scheme (in MRtrix format, see main documentation for details).\n- an image file whose header contains a valid DW encoding scheme\n\nIf a full DW encoding is provided, the number of shells needs to match those found in the input image of coefficients (i.e. its size along the 5th dimension). If needed, the -shell option can be used to pick out the specific shell(s) of interest.\n\nIf the input image contains multiple shells (its size along the 5th dimension is greater than one), the program will expect the direction set to contain multiple shells, which can only be provided as a full DW encodings (the last two options in the list above).\n\nThe spherical harmonic coefficients are stored according the conventions described the main documentation, which can be found at the following link: \nhttps://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.4/concepts/spherical_harmonics.html\n\nReferences:\n\n",
