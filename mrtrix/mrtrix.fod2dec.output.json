  "description": "Generate FOD-based DEC maps, with optional panchromatic sharpening and/or luminance/perception correction.\n\nBy default, the FOD-based DEC is weighted by the integral of the FOD. To weight by another scalar map, use the -contrast option. This option can also be used for panchromatic sharpening, e.g., by supplying a T1 (or other sensible) anatomical volume with a higher spatial resolution.\n\nReferences:\n\nDhollander T, Smith RE, Tournier JD, Jeurissen B, Connelly A.
