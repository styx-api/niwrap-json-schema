  "description": "Generate a set of uniformly distributed directions using a bipolar electrostatic repulsion model.\n\nDirections are distributed by analogy to an electrostatic repulsion system, with each direction corresponding to a single electrostatic charge (for -unipolar), or a pair of diametrically opposed charges (for the default bipolar case). The energy of the system is determined based on the Coulomb repulsion, which assumes the form 1/r^power, where r is the distance between any pair of charges, and p is the power assumed for the repulsion law (default: 1). The minimum energy state is obtained by gradient descent.\n\nReferences:\n\nJones, D.; Horsfield, M. & Simmons, A.
