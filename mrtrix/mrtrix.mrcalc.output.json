  "description": "Apply generic voxel-wise mathematical operations to images.\n\nThis command will only compute per-voxel operations. Use 'mrmath' to compute summary statistics across images or along image axes.\n\nThis command uses a stack-based syntax, with operators (specified using options) operating on the top-most entries (i.e. images or values) in the stack. Operands (values or images) are pushed onto the stack in the order they appear (as arguments) on the command-line, and operators (specified as options) operate on and consume the top-most entries in the stack, and push their output as a new entry on the stack.\n\nAs an additional feature, this command will allow images with different dimensions to be processed, provided they satisfy the following conditions: for each axis, the dimensions match if they are the same size, or one of them has size one. In the latter case, the entire image will be replicated along that axis. This allows for example a 4D image of size [ X Y Z N ] to be added to a 3D image of size [ X Y Z ], as if it consisted of N copies of the 3D image along the 4th axis (the missing dimension is assumed to have size 1). Another example would a single-voxel 4D image of size [ 1 1 1 N ], multiplied by a 3D image of size [ X Y Z ], which would allow the creation of a 4D image where each volume consists of the 3D image scaled by the corresponding value for that volume in the single-voxel image.\n\nReferences:\n\n",
