  "description": "Invert a non-linear warp field.\n\nBy default, this command assumes that the input warp field is a deformation field, i.e. each voxel stores the corresponding position in the other image (in scanner space), and the calculated output warp image will also be a deformation field. If the input warp field is instead a displacment field, i.e. where each voxel stores an offset from which to sample the other image (but still in scanner space), then the -displacement option should be used; the output warp field will additionally be calculated as a displacement field in this case.\n\nReferences:\n\n",
