  "description": "Resample each streamline in a track file to a new set of vertices.\n\nIt is necessary to specify precisely ONE of the command-line options for controlling how this resampling takes place; this may be either increasing or decreasing the number of samples along each streamline, or may involve changing the positions of the samples according to some specified trajectory.\n\nNote that because the length of a streamline is calculated based on the sums of distances between adjacent vertices, resampling a streamline to a new set of vertices will typically change the quantified length of that streamline; the magnitude of the difference will typically depend on the discrepancy in the number of vertices, with less vertices leading to a shorter length (due to taking chordal lengths of curved trajectories).\n\nReferences:\n\n",
