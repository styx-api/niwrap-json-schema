The output ODF lobes are scaled according to the values in the input fixel image.\n\nThe spherical harmonic coefficients are stored according the conventions described the main documentation, which can be found at the following link: \nhttps://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.4/concepts/spherical_harmonics.html\n\nReferences:\n\n",
