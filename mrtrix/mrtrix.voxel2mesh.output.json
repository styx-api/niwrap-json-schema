  "description": "Generate a surface mesh representation from a voxel image.\n\nThis command utilises the Marching Cubes algorithm to generate a polygonal surface that represents the isocontour(s) of the input image at a particular intensity. By default, an appropriate threshold will be determined automatically from the input image, however the intensity value of the isocontour(s) can instead be set manually using the -threhsold option.\n\nIf the -blocky option is used, then the Marching Cubes algorithm will not be used. Instead, the input image will be interpreted as a binary mask image, and polygonal surfaces will be generated at the outer faces of the voxel clusters within the mask.\n\nReferences:\n\n",
