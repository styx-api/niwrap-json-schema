  "description": "Convert between different representations of a non-linear warp.\n\nA deformation field is defined as an image where each voxel defines the corresponding position in the other image (in scanner space coordinates). A displacement field stores the displacements (in mm) to the other image from the each voxel's position (in scanner space). The warpfull file is the 5D format output from mrregister -nl_warp_full, which contains linear transforms, warps and their inverses that map each image to a midway space.\n\nReferences:\n\n",
