  "description": "Compute summary statistic on image intensities either across images, or along a specified axis of a single image.\n\nSupported operations are:\n\nmean, median, sum, product, rms (root-mean-square value), norm (vector 2-norm), var (unbiased variance), std (unbiased standard deviation), min, max, absmax (maximum absolute value), magmax (value with maximum absolute value, preserving its sign).\n\nThis command is used to traverse either along an image axis, or across a set of input images, calculating some statistic from the values along each traversal. If you are seeking to instead perform mathematical calculations that are done independently for each voxel, pleaase see the 'mrcalc' command.\n\nReferences:\n\n",
