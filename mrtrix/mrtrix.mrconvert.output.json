  "description": "Perform conversion between different file types and optionally extract a subset of the input image.\n\nIf used correctly, this program can be a very useful workhorse. In addition to converting images between different formats, it can be used to extract specific studies from a data set, extract a specific region of interest, or flip the images. Some of the possible operations are described in more detail below.\n\nNote that for both the -coord and -axes options, indexing starts from 0 rather than 1. E.g. -coord 3 <#> selects volumes (the fourth dimension) from the series; -axes 0,1,2 includes only the three spatial axes in the output image.\n\nAdditionally, for the second input to the -coord option and the -axes option, you can use any valid number sequence in the selection, as well as the 'end' keyword (see the main documentation for details); this can be particularly useful to select multiple coordinates.\n\nThe -vox option is used to change the size of the voxels in the output image as reported in the image header; note however that this does not re-sample the image based on a new voxel size (that is done using the mrgrid command).\n\nBy default, the intensity scaling parameters in the input image header are passed through to the output image header when writing to an integer image, and reset to 0,1 (i.e. no scaling) for floating-point and binary images. Note that the -scaling option will therefore have no effect for floating-point or binary output images.\n\nThe -axes option specifies which axes from the input image will be used to form the output image. This allows the permutation, omission, or addition of axes into the output image. The axes should be supplied as a comma-separated list of axis indices. If an axis from the input image is to be omitted from the output image, it must either already have a size of 1, or a single coordinate along that axis must be selected by the user by using the -coord option. Examples are provided further below.\n\nThe -bvalue_scaling option controls an aspect of the import of diffusion gradient tables. When the input diffusion-weighting direction vectors have norms that differ substantially from unity, the b-values will be scaled by the square of their corresponding vector norm (this is how multi-shell acquisitions are frequently achieved on scanner platforms). However in some rare instances, the b-values may be correct, despite the vectors not being of unit norm (or conversely, the b-values may need to be rescaled even though the vectors are close to unit norm). This option allows the user to control this operation and override MRrtix3's automatic detection.\n\nReferences:\n\n",
