ROIs are always treated as weighting functions, including negative values.  For efficiency, ensure that everything that is not intended to be used is zero in the ROI map.  If -cifti-roi is specified, -left-roi, -right-roi, -cerebellum-roi, and -vol-roi must not be specified.  If multiple non-cifti ROI files are specified, they must have the same number of columns.",
