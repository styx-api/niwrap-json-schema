  "description": "PERFORM REDUCTION OPERATION ACROSS METRIC COLUMNS.\n\nFor each surface vertex, takes the data across columns as a vector, and performs the specified reduction on it, putting the result into the single output column at that vertex.  The reduction operators are as follows:\n\nMAX: the maximum value\nMIN: the minimum value\nINDEXMAX: the 1-based index of the maximum value\nINDEXMIN: the 1-based index of the minimum value\nSUM: add all values\nPRODUCT: multiply all values\nMEAN: the mean of the data\nSTDEV: the standard deviation (N denominator)\nSAMPSTDEV: the sample standard deviation (N-1 denominator)\nVARIANCE: the variance of the data\nTSNR: mean divided by sample standard deviation (N-1 denominator)\nCOV: sample standard deviation (N-1 denominator) divided by mean\nL2NORM: square root of sum of squares\nMEDIAN: the median of the data\nMODE: the mode of the data\nCOUNT_NONZERO: the number of nonzero elements in the data\n",
