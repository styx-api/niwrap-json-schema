  "description": "REGRESS AFFINE FROM WARPFIELD.\n\nFor all voxels in the warpfield, do a regression that predicts the post-warp coordinate from the source coordinate.  When -roi is specified, only consider voxels with a value greater than 0 in <roi-vol>.\n\nThe default is to expect the warpfield to be in relative world coordinates (mm space), and to write the output as a world affine (mm space to mm space).  If you are using FSL-created files and utilities, specify -fnirt and -flirt-out as needed, as their coordinate conventions are different.",
