  "description": "OFFSCREEN RENDERING OF SCENE TO AN IMAGE FILE.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRender content of browser windows displayed in a scene into image file(s).\n\nIf none of the \"-size\" options are specified, the default is \"-size-window\" (Output image is size of the window that was saved in the scene).\n\nFor the \"-size\" options that accept a width and/or height, the values default to number of pixels.  To express the width and/or height in physical units (inches, centimeters, etc.), use the \"-units\" option.  When physical units are used, the pixel width and height are derived using the physical width/height and the image resolution (see the \"-resolution\" option).\n\nNote that scenes created prior to version 1.2 (May 2016) do not contain information about the size of the window.  Therefore, one must use the \"-size-width-height\" option.\n\nExamples:\n\nGenerate an image of the second scene.  Width and height of image is width and height of window saved in the scene.  \n   wb_command -scene-capture-image myscene.scene 2 image2.jpg\n\nGenerate an image of the second scene with a margin around sides of the image. Width and height of image is width and height of window saved in the scene.  \n   wb_command -scene-capture-image myscene.scene 2 image2.jpg  -margin 10\n\nGenerate an image of the second scene that is 6 inches width with 300 pixels per inch.  The resulting width is 1800 pixels.  The resulting height of the image is a function of the width and the aspect ratio (height divided by width) of the window size saved in the scene.\n   wb_command -scene-capture-image myscene.scene 2 image21.jpg \\ \n   -size-width 6 -units INCHES -resolution 300 PIXELS_PER_INCH\n\nPrint information about the size of the output image for the second scene (no image file is created) using a width of 4.5 centimeters. \n   wb_command -scene-capture-image myscene.scene 2 test.jpg \\ \n   -size-width 4.5 -units CENTIMETERS -print-image-info\n\n\n",
