  "description": "FIND EXTREMA IN A VOLUME FILE.\n\nFinds extrema in a volume file, such that no two extrema of the same type are within <distance> of each other.  The extrema are labeled as -1 for minima, 1 for maxima, 0 otherwise.  If -only-maxima or -only-minima is specified, then it will ignore extrema not of the specified type.  These options are mutually exclusive.\n\nIf -sum-subvols is specified, these extrema subvolumes are summed, and the output has a single subvolume with this result.\n\nBy default, a datapoint is an extrema only if it is more extreme than every other datapoint that is within <distance> from it.  If -consolidate-mode is used, it instead starts by finding all datapoints that are more extreme than their immediate neighbors, then while there are any extrema within <distance> of each other, take the two extrema closest to each other and merge them into one by a weighted average based on how many original extrema have been merged into each.\n\nBy default, all input subvolumes are used with no smoothing, use -subvolume to specify a single subvolume to use, and -presmooth to smooth the input before finding the extrema.",
