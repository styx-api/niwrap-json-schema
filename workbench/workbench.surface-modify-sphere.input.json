  "description": "Change radius and optionally recenter a sphere.\n\nThis command may be useful if you have used -surface-resample to resample a sphere, which can suffer from problems generally not present in -surface-sphere-project-unproject.  If the sphere should already be centered around the origin, using -recenter may still shift it slightly before changing the radius, which is likely to be undesireable.\n\nIf <sphere-in> is not close to spherical, or not centered around the origin and -recenter is not used, a warning is printed.",
