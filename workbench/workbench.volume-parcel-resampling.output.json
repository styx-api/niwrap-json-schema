  "description": "Smooth and resample volume parcels.\n\nSmooths and resamples the region inside each label in cur-parcels to the region of the same label name in new-parcels.  Any voxels in the output label region but outside the input label region will be extrapolated from nearby data.  The -fix-zeros option causes the smoothing to not use an input value if it is zero, but still write a smoothed value to the voxel, and after smoothing is complete, it will check for any remaining values of zero, and fill them in with extrapolated values.\n\nNote: all volumes must have the same dimensions and spacing.  To use a different output space, see -volume-parcel-resampling-generic.",
