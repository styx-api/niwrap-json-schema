  "description": "Resample a cifti file to a new cifti space.\n\nResample cifti data to a different brainordinate space.  Use COLUMN for the direction to resample dscalar, dlabel, or dtseries.  Resampling both dimensions of a dconn requires running this command twice, once with COLUMN and once with ROW.  If you are resampling a dconn and your machine has a large amount of memory, you might consider using -cifti-resample-dconn-memory to avoid writing and rereading an intermediate file.  The <template-direction> argument should usually be COLUMN, as dtseries, dscalar, and dlabel all have brainordinates on that direction.  If spheres are not specified for a surface structure which exists in the cifti files, its data is copied without resampling or dilation.  Dilation is done with the 'nearest' method, and is done on <new-sphere> for surface data.  Volume components are padded before dilation so that dilation doesn't run into the edge of the component bounding box.  If neither -affine nor -warpfield are specified, the identity transform is assumed for the volume data.\n\nThe recommended resampling methods are ADAP_BARY_AREA and CUBIC (cubic spline), except for label data which should use ADAP_BARY_AREA and ENCLOSING_VOXEL.  Using ADAP_BARY_AREA requires specifying an area option to each used -*-spheres option.\n\nThe <volume-method> argument must be one of the following:\n\nCUBIC\nENCLOSING_VOXEL\nTRILINEAR\n\nThe <surface-method> argument must be one of the following:\n\nADAP_BARY_AREA\nBARYCENTRIC\n",
