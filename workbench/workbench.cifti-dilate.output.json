  "description": "Dilate a cifti file.\n\nFor all data values designated as bad, if they neighbor a good value or are within the specified distance of a good value in the same kind of model, replace the value with a distance weighted average of nearby good values, otherwise set the value to zero.  If -nearest is specified, it will use the value from the closest good value within range instead of a weighted average.  When the input file contains label data, nearest dilation is used on the surface, and weighted popularity is used in the volume.\n\nThe -*-corrected-areas options are intended for dilating on group average surfaces, but it is only an approximate correction for the reduction of structure in a group average surface.\n\nIf -bad-brainordinate-roi is specified, all values, including those with value zero, are good, except for locations with a positive value in the ROI.  If it is not specified, only values equal to zero are bad.",
