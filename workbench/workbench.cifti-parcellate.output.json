  "description": "Parcellate a cifti file.\n\nEach label (other than the unlabeled key) in the cifti label file will be treated as a parcel, and all rows or columns of data within the parcel are averaged together to form the parcel's output row or column.  If -legacy-mode is specified, parcels will be defined as the overlap between a label and the data, with no errors for missing data vertices or voxels, and empty parcels discarded.  The direction can be either an integer starting from 1, or the strings 'ROW' or 'COLUMN'.  For dtseries or dscalar, use COLUMN.  If you are parcellating a dconn in both directions, parcellating by ROW first will use much less memory.\n\nNOTE: the parcels in the output file are sorted by the numeric label keys, in ascending order.\n\nThe parameter to the -method option must be one of the following:\n\nMAX: the maximum value\nMIN: the minimum value\nINDEXMAX: the 1-based index of the maximum value\nINDEXMIN: the 1-based index of the minimum value\nSUM: add all values\nPRODUCT: multiply all values\nMEAN: the mean of the data\nSTDEV: the standard deviation (N denominator)\nSAMPSTDEV: the sample standard deviation (N-1 denominator)\nVARIANCE: the variance of the data\nTSNR: mean divided by sample standard deviation (N-1 denominator)\nCOV: sample standard deviation (N-1 denominator) divided by mean\nL2NORM: square root of sum of squares\nMEDIAN: the median of the data\nMODE: the mode of the data\nCOUNT_NONZERO: the number of nonzero elements in the data\n\nThe -*-weights options are mutually exclusive and may only be used with MEAN (default), SUM, STDEV, SAMPSTDEV, VARIANCE, MEDIAN, or MODE (default for label data).",
