  "description": "Dilate a volume file.\n\nFor all voxels that are designated as bad, if they neighbor a non-bad voxel with data or are within the specified distance of such a voxel, replace the value in the bad voxel with a value calculated from nearby non-bad voxels that have data, otherwise set the value to zero.  No matter how small <distance> is, dilation will always use at least the face neighbor voxels.\n\nBy default, voxels that have data with the value 0 are bad, specify -bad-voxel-roi to only count voxels as bad if they are selected by the roi.  If -data-roi is not specified, all voxels are assumed to have data.\n\nTo get the behavior of version 1.3.2 or earlier, use '-legacy-cutoff -exponent 2'.\n\nValid values for <method> are:\n\nNEAREST - use the value from the nearest good voxel\nWEIGHTED - use a weighted average based on distance",
