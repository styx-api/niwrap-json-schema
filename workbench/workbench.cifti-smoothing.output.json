  "description": "Smooth a cifti file.\n\nThe input cifti file must have a brain models mapping on the chosen dimension, columns for .dtseries, and either for .dconn.  By default, data in different structures is smoothed independently (i.e., \"parcel constrained\" smoothing), so volume structures that touch do not smooth across this boundary.  Specify -merged-volume to ignore these boundaries.  Surface smoothing uses the GEO_GAUSS_AREA smoothing method.\n\nThe -*-corrected-areas options are intended for when it is unavoidable to smooth on group average surfaces, it is only an approximate correction for the reduction of structure in a group average surface.  It is better to smooth the data on individuals before averaging, when feasible.\n\nThe -fix-zeros-* options will treat values of zero as lack of data, and not use that value when generating the smoothed values, but will fill zeros with extrapolated values.  The ROI should have a brain models mapping along columns, exactly matching the mapping of the chosen direction in the input file.  Data outside the ROI is ignored.",
